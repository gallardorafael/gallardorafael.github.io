## Research projects

### Current projects
1. Thesis work: Image Captioning with Reading Comprehension: Working with novel deep learning techniques, trying to outperform the
state-of-the-art over the TextCaps dataset for OCR-based image captioning. This project will also have an embedded implementation to help blind people understand the world around them.
2. A Convolutional Autoencoder for Single Image Super-Resolution: Developing a new architecture for single image super-resolution. The
project is based on convolutional autoencoders. I’m trying to beat the standard algorithms such as Lanczos resampling or bilineal/bicubic interpolations.
3. Approaches to Differential Privacy in Deep Learning Techniques: A literature review of the different approaches to implement the
Differential Privacy model on deep learning architectures.
